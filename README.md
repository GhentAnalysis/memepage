# Make a webpage with memes to display on the screen in the coffee room

### How to use
The webpage is constructed from two ingredients:
- A collection of memes (usually in `.png` format). 
- An `index.php` file managing the layout of the webpage.  

The memes and `index.php` file should be placed together in a subfolder of `public_html` in your T2B home directory, for example in `/user/$USER/public_html/memes`. See below for instructions on how to create the `public_html` folder correctly.

### How to set up a public html directory
See [this T2B Wiki page](https://t2bwiki.iihe.ac.be/PublicWebpages).
Once you created the directory and gave the correct permissions, you can view it via https://homepage.iihe.ac.be/~$USER/test/

### How to get memes
These can be collected from anywhere you want. However, this repository contains some helper scripts to make the process of meme managing easier:
- `collect_memes_from_users.py`: use this script to collect and download memes from all T2B users.
